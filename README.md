# getdata-033 Project

This project consists of the single R script `run_analysis.R`.

The script expects to find the sub-directory `UCI HAR Dataset` and under that
the sub-directories `test` and `train`.

Each of these sub-directories contains an activity, subject and observation
file processed and combined into a single data frame by the `run_analysis.R`
script.

Execute the `run_analysis.R` script from the project root folder.

A full description of the processes performed by the `run_analysis.R` script
is given in the `CodeBook.md` file in this repository.
